			<h2>Intro</h2>
			<p> I'm 19 years old and I'm a student at Thinkful. I'm a very outgoing person who loves to meet new people! Born and raised in Manhattan, New York with a passion to code and learn new things. I try to think outside of the box and bring new and more refreshing ideas to the field. I'm thankful to be part of this wonderful community and ready to learn more about coding.  </p>

			<h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm incredibliy tenacious and love to problem solve. I work well with others and I'm pretty easy going. Before coding I used to pursue the arts and it occured to me that there isn't that much intersection between those topics and I want to change that. My goal is to become a more seasoned software developer so I can have the tools to complete the projects I want to demonstrate to the world, so I'm excited for the new journey ahead. </p>
      <p> Outside of my career goals I like to keep a wide range of hobbies. As well as staying active through sports or dance. Most of the time I spend listening to all kinds of music and learning new dance styles.</p>
